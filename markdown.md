# What is Markdown?

Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags.
Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently across device types. (Info found from IBM)
