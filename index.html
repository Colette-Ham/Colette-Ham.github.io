    <h2> HTML </h2>
        <p> The <i>HyperText Markup Language</i> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <mark>It defines the content and structure of web content.</mark> It is often assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and /p surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.  </p>

    <h2> CSS </h2>
      <p> It is a design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
        CSS determines the visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. 
        CSS allows you to format the design, style, font, and color of text; set margins and padding; background colors, and border styles.</p>

    <h2> Theory </h2>
<ol type="1">
   <li>The internet backbone is the core of a network. This is where other, smaller sites go to exchange data.</li>
   <li>A client is a program that makes requests to a server. A server is a program that fulfills those requests.</li>
   <li>The servers get the data at least to your house, where the router takes over and forwards that data to the correct device and makes sure any data that's coming in or out is safe.
   Just as a switch connects multiple devices to create a network, a router connects multiple switches, and their respective networks, to form an even larger network. 
	   These networks may be in a single location or across multiple locations.</li>
<li>There are four layers of the TCP/IP model: network access, internet, transport, and application. Used together, these layers are a suite of protocols. 
	The TCP/IP model passes data through these layers in a particular order when a user sends information, and then again in reverse order when the data is received.</li>
	 <li>Examples of computer applications that use the clientâ€“server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.</li>
   <li>a software system that links topics on the screen to related information and graphics, which are typically accessed by a point-and-click method.</li>
   <li>The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred to formally as World Wide Web (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the Internet. 
	   Another way to look at this difference is; the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is served on top of that infrastructure.</li>
<li>A client sends an HTTP request to a server, specifying the desired action, such as retrieving a web page or submitting form data. 
	The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and the requested content (if applicable).</li>
	 <li>HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication. 
		As the name suggests, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. 
		 In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.</li>
   <li>Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "participative social Web," and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web." 
	   This Web interaction and utilization stage moves users away from centralized platforms like Facebook, Google, or Twitter and towards decentralized, nearly anonymous platforms.</li>
   <li>User Interaction: Web 1.0 was primarily about static content and minimal user interaction, while Web 2.0 introduced dynamic and interactive user experiences. 
	   Web 3.0 aims to take interactivity to the next level by making the web smarter and more context-aware.</li>
<li>Markup languages are systems that use tags to format and annotate text or data, providing instructions on how it should be displayed or processed. 
	They're most often used in web development to define the structure and presentation of web pages.</li>
	 <li>IMarkup languages are used to structure and format text and other content on a webpage. 
		 Programming languages are used to create software applications and operating systems.
		 Scripting languages are used to automate tasks and add functionality to applications.</li>
   <li>SGML, HTML, and XML is a family of languages that help make websites functional and web design dynamic.</li>
   <li>In Grade 7 I made a webiste using HTML</li>
<li>If I ever want to create a website, I have the tools to do so now</li>
